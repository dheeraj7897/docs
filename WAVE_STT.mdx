🎙️ Waves STT: Asynchronous Transcription

The Waves Speech-to-Text (STT) API provides highly accurate, asynchronous transcription for pre-recorded audio files. This process returns a job ID, which you must use to retrieve the final transcript after processing is complete.

⚡️ Quick Start: File Transcription

Endpoint

Header

Value / Type

Description

Authorization

Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>

Required. Your Waves API key.

Sample Request (Python)

Send your audio file as multipart form data:

import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
FILE_PATH = "path/to/my_audio.mp3"
URL = "[https://api.waves.ai/v1/transcribe](https://api.waves.ai/v1/transcribe)"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"
}

with open(FILE_PATH, 'rb') as f:
    response = requests.post(URL, headers=headers, files={'file': f})

if response.status_code == 202:
    print("Job submitted successfully:", response.json())


Sample Response (Job Submission)

{
  "job_id": "60a2b4f8-e1c3-4d5a-8b0f-9c7d2e1a4f3b",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "created_at": "2025-11-14T15:00:00Z"
}


Tip: Do not poll the job status endpoint immediately. Wait at least 5 seconds before checking the /jobs/{job_id} endpoint to avoid unnecessary rate limiting.

Next Steps

To complete the transcription process, you would now use the returned job_id to query the /jobs/{job_id} GET endpoint until the status changes to "completed".
